hell of a hot tub you have there
Into the cauldron, handsome!
why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm sorry, Aunt Lydia
fucking magnets, how do they work?
as I live and breathe
it irks me
not this time, constable
Originally discovered in jellyfish
The big yellow one is the sun
everyone hates the cave people
i brought the marmalade, captain
no, that's my cookbook
i hear the owl
eyes on your own work there, chief
this isn't my cat
Curry is in me
And the donkeys
i wear the witches tarten
fry the cabbage on both sides
I still see the deer
i don't know her
now we have this spoon situation
a bad tooth spoils a bike ride
where are the crows?
who has the sardine bag?
knee still itches
you didn't bring the biscuits
choccy ones are also excellent
